## Usage

The website works like any regular website but to use the shopping chart, simply head to the menu section and hover over the image of your choice.
There, you can interact with how many items you want. Then go to the shopping cart button all the way to the top of the homepage to see what you've
ordered and total sale price.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Bootstrap

I originally created this website using good ol' HTML and CSS but then I had the idea of converting it into React and making it useable. I've used
different React components for each section of the website. It got a bit messy at first but I was able to overrcome it. Then, I added the CSS 
in addition and later on installed Bootstrap in order to make a good looking shopping cart. I worked on the shopping cart module in order to calculate
the price of the items in the cart. From there, I had to figure out how to use a different
styling method as my original hover style for the menu images did not want to work with Bootstrap. I managed to get it fixed and used the original
style I intended it for instead of using Bootstrap styles that it came with.

## Optimizations

I wanted to get it connected with Stripe and that's really all I wanted but don't really see the need since it's 
a demo. Possibly have a working slide show but that's it.

## Lessons Learned:

I thought converting a static CSS into mobile friendly was rough but converting a website to React is a battle of it's own. Not impossible, but if you're
starting out with React, it can get pretty tricky, especially if certain CSS elements suddenly stopped working.
